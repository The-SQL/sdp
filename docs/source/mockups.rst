Layout
------

- **Ample White Space**: Intentionally used to prevent clutter and allow content to breathe, creating a clean and open layout.
- **Typography**: Establishes a clear hierarchy with a highly readable font family. Variations in font weight, size, and color (e.g., dark grey instead of pure black) guide the user's eye, distinguishing titles, subtitles, body text, and labels without visual noise.
- **Color Palette**: Employs a restrained and purposeful scheme. A primary color is used sparingly for interactive elements like buttons and icons to make them stand out. Neutral tones (whites, light grays) form a calm, focused foundation conducive to learning.
- **Imagery & Icons**: Uses a cohesive set of streamlined, minimalist icons for universal recognition. Imagery is intentional, not decorative, enhancing the learning experience (e.g., cultural photos in language lessons).
- **Micro-Interactions**:
  - Smooth transitions between screens.
  - Buttons change color slightly on hover or press.
  - Loading indicators appear while content is fetched.
  
  These details contribute to a **sleek**, modern feel and provide clear feedback on user actions.
- **Functionality Clarity**: Demonstrates how interactive elements operate, such as flipping flashcards, selecting quiz answers, and using dropdown menus, ensuring functionality is intuitive.

Our Chosen Design Philosophy: "Clean & Sleek"
--------------------------------------------

We have deliberately chosen a **clean and sleek** UI for the following reasons:

- **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Learning a new language is mentally demanding. A clean interface eliminates distractions, allowing learners to focus on lesson content without bright, conflicting colors or chaotic layouts.
- **Projects Professionalism & Trust**: A modern, sleek design signals credibility and quality, encouraging users to trust and invest time in the platform.
- **Enhances Usability**: Clarity ensures usability. Clear buttons, legible text, and obvious navigation paths make the platform accessible and enjoyable for all users.
- **Timelessness**: Clean design ages well, avoiding the need for frequent visual overhauls and reducing long-term design debt.

The interface prioritizes the user's learning journey, acting as a calm, intuitive, and efficient conduit for knowledge.
