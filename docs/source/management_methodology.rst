Management Methodology
======================

Our team adopted the **Scrum methodology**, a subset of Agile development focused on iterative progress, adaptability, and collaboration. This approach allows us to work efficiently through short, structured cycles called **sprints**, ensuring continuous delivery of functional product increments while incorporating feedback from stakeholders throughout the development process. Scrum was chosen for its ability to foster transparency, accountability, and consistent improvement within the team.

Choice of Development Methodology
--------------------------------

Scrum was selected due to its flexibility and emphasis on continuous feedback and collaboration. Its iterative nature allowed the team to refine requirements and deliver features incrementally, ensuring alignment with the stakeholder’s vision at every stage. Each sprint produced a potentially shippable product increment, maintaining focus on functionality and user value. This methodology also supports adaptability—crucial for addressing evolving client needs and unforeseen challenges efficiently.

Following of Development Methodology
-----------------------------------

Roles
~~~~~

- **Product Owner – Mayuri:**
    
    The stakeholder who represented the end-users, clarified requirements, and prioritized features in the product backlog to ensure business objectives were met.
    
- **Scrum Master – Kamogelo Khumalo:**
    
    Responsible for facilitating Scrum ceremonies, removing impediments, maintaining focus, and ensuring adherence to Agile principles.
    
- **Development Team – Wilfred Banda, Priyanka Gohil, and Emmanuel Azubuike:**
    
    Collaboratively handled system design, coding, testing, and documentation. The team worked cross-functionally to deliver high-quality increments each sprint.
    
To maintain healthy collaboration, the team agreed that any internal disputes would first be resolved privately. If unresolved, the Scrum Master would mediate to achieve a fair outcome while maintaining team cohesion.

Scrum Process
-------------

1. Sprint Planning and Backlog Refinement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of each sprint, the team conducted **Sprint Planning** and **Backlog Refinement** sessions. These meetings were used to:

- Review and prioritize the **product backlog** — a comprehensive list of features, improvements, and bugs.
- Define **sprint goals** aligned with stakeholder priorities.
- Estimate **story points** to measure task complexity.
- Assign tasks to members based on workload and expertise.
- Finalize the **sprint backlog** and document it on **Notion**, where progress was tracked via a Kanban board.

Story points followed a clear system:

+---------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Points  | Complexity   | Effort Required  | Example Task        |
+=========+==============+==================+=====================+
| 1       | Trivial      | Few hours        | Small UI fixes      |
+---------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| 2       | Simple       | Half day         | CRUD operations     |
+---------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| 3       | Medium       | 1–2 days         | API integration     |
+---------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| 5       | High         | 3–4 days         | Multi-step logic or |
|         |              |                  | modules             |
+---------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| 10      | Extremely    | 7 days+          | Highly logical      |
|         | High         |                  |                     |
+---------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+

Consensus on estimations was achieved through discussion, promoting understanding of technical constraints and workload balance.

2. Daily Operations (Stand-ups)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure transparency and communication, **stand-up meetings** were conducted three times a week (virtually or in person). Each team member briefly shared:

- What they accomplished since the last meeting.
- What they planned to work on next.
- Any blockers or challenges encountered.

This ensured early problem detection (e.g., API integration issues) and alignment across the team. Weekly stakeholder meetings were also held for direct feedback and to present progress on sprint deliverables.

3. Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of each sprint:

- A **Sprint Review** was conducted to demo completed features to stakeholders and gather feedback for refinement.
- A **Sprint Retrospective** was held internally to reflect on the sprint process and identify improvements.

Each retrospective addressed three key points:

- **What went well:** Efficient collaboration, timely completion of core tasks.
- **What could improve:** Time allocation for testing and bug fixing.
- **Action items:** Implemented in the next sprint to enhance efficiency and code quality.

This process enabled the team to improve continuously and maintain a cycle of learning and adaptation.

Tools Supporting Our Scrum Process

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+

These tools ensured transparent collaboration and centralized communication, minimizing misalignment during development.

Evidence of Work
---------------

The team maintained detailed and up-to-date visual and written documentation across all sprints:

1. **Kanban Boards:**
    
    Each sprint included a Notion Kanban board with three stages — *Not Started*, *In Progress*, and *Done*. Tasks were labeled with priority levels (**low**, **medium**, **high**) and assigned to specific members. This visualization enhanced productivity and accountability.
    
2. **Product Backlog:**
    
    Structured as a table on Notion, listing all features, enhancements, and bugs. Each record included the task name, type, priority, due date, sprint association, and status.
    
3. **Meeting Documentation:**
    
    Every Scrum ceremony — including Sprint Planning, Refinement, Stand-ups, Reviews, and Retrospectives — was documented in Google Docs. Entries included meeting date, attendees, purpose, discussions, and outcomes.
    
4. **Stakeholder Feedback:**
    
    Weekly feedback sessions ensured that product changes reflected real user needs. Suggestions from these meetings directly influenced the following sprint’s backlog.
    
This meticulous documentation and adherence to Scrum principles ensured that every team member remained informed, the project stayed on schedule, and continuous improvements were achieved.

Summary
-------

By following the **Scrum methodology**, our team maintained an efficient and collaborative workflow. Structured meetings, defined roles, transparent documentation, and iterative development cycles allowed us to stay responsive to change while continuously delivering value. The consistent use of management tools like Notion, Google Meet, and GitHub provided visibility and ensured accountability across all sprints, resulting in an organized and adaptable development process that aligned with Agile best practices.
