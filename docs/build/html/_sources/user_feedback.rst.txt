Analysis of Feedback
-------------------

For all sprints, we received very positive feedback regarding the clean and aesthetic UI of the web app.

**Sprint 2**

Feedback focused primarily on **mobile responsiveness** and **content layout consistency**. Several users reported that certain pages, particularly the *Manage Course Page*, did not render properly on mobile devices. To address this, we implemented responsive design fixes and ensured visual uniformity by truncating long course descriptions to three lines, giving all course cards a cleaner and more structured appearance.

Users appreciated the site’s simplicity and design but expressed a desire for a **user dashboard** and **landing page**—features that were noted and moved to the backlog for Sprint 3. Feature-related feedback also pointed to limited **video player functionality**, as learners could only play or pause videos. In response, we enhanced the player to include controls such as **2x playback speed**, **skip forward/backward**, and **progress tracking**. Additionally, we introduced **filtering options** on the Explore Courses page, allowing users to sort by highest-rated or most-enrolled courses, significantly improving the browsing experience.

Overall, Sprint 2 established a strong foundation for user satisfaction with design and usability, while identifying critical areas for further development in terms of responsiveness, accessibility, and interactivity.

**Sprint 3**

Feedback highlighted major usability improvements and user engagement features. Many returning users noticed **significant enhancements** from the previous sprint, particularly the introduction of a **dashboard**. However, users also requested more **personalized analytics**. We responded by integrating stats such as *Lessons Completed*, *Courses Completed*, *Languages Mastered*, and *Current Streaks* and enabling users to set **personal learning goals** directly from their dashboard.

Several users noted the need for **better quiz feedback**, particularly when a question was answered incorrectly. As a result, we updated the quiz system to display the **correct answer after an incorrect response**, improving the learning experience. Users also requested improvements to **community interaction**, suggesting features like liking and replying to comments, and tagging users. These were successfully added, promoting more engaging discussions. The **course cards** were redesigned to be **fully clickable** for better accessibility, and **profile badges** were introduced to reward learning achievements and encourage consistency.

In summary, Sprint 3 marked a key milestone where the platform evolved from focusing on core functionality to enhancing **personalization, engagement, and interactivity**, aligning well with user expectations.

**Sprint 4**

Feedback primarily revolved around **performance optimization** and **new learning tools**. Users initially reported **slow loading times**, which were subsequently improved through optimization, leading to **Google Lighthouse performance scores near 99** across pages. The **landing page** was polished to better convey the platform’s purpose, although a few users still suggested minor visual refinements.

Newly introduced **flashcards** received positive feedback for ease of use and design consistency. Users suggested additional capabilities, such as a **search function for flashcard sets**, **public sharing options similar to Quizlet**, and **the ability to explore other users’ flashcards**—features that were added. Another major request was for a **notification system**, allowing users to receive alerts when someone replies to or likes their comments in discussions. This system was successfully implemented by the end of the sprint.

Overall, Sprint 4 feedback reflected a mature and polished product phase, emphasizing **performance, discoverability, and interactivity**. Users expressed satisfaction with both the learning experience and social engagement aspects, signaling that the platform had achieved a high standard of usability and feature completeness.

     - There is no landing page or dashboard for users. Users don't know what courses they are enrolled in unless they navigate to that specific course. However, the website looks very clean. Well done!
