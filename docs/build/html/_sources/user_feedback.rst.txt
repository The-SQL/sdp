Testing Script & Tasks
---------------------

**Introduction**: "Thank you for helping us test OSLearn. Today, we're evaluating how easy it is to discover and evaluate courses on our platform. Please verbalize your thoughts, feelings, and frustrations as you complete the tasks. There are no right or wrong answers; we're testing the platform, not you."

**Task 1: Discovery**

"Imagine you want to learn basic Italian for an upcoming trip. Please find a suitable beginner Italian course."

**Task 2: Evaluation**

"Now, please decide if you would enroll in this course. What information helps you make this decision?"

**Task 3: Personal Management**

"Please find the page where you can see all the courses you're currently taking and check your progress in one of them."

**Task 4: Profile Review**

"Please find and update your profile bio to say 'Learning Italian and Japanese'."

**Task 5: Course Creation**

"You've decided to create a short course on 'Coffee Shop Spanish'. Please use the course creation system to set up this course. Add a unit called 'Greetings and Ordering' with one video lesson and one text-based lesson on vocabulary."
