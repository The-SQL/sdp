Introduction
============


OSLearn, our Open Source Language Learning Platform, had one mission rooted in its name. Traditionally, open source refers to software whose code can be inspected, modified and enhanced by anyone. With regards to this project, this principle extends beyond the code itself but now applies to the content within the platform. So essentially, OSLearn is a community-driven ecosystem where every learner and creator can equally contribute, modify and improve the learning material collaboratively. Ultimately, it is a collective project aimed at building the most accessible language learning tool possible, shaped by the shared expertise and participation of its user base.

The motivation for developing OSLearn came from recognising how limited most language learning tools are in terms of flexibility and openness. Many existing platforms provide structured content but restrict how users can interact with or expand it. We wanted to bridge that gap by creating a platform that not only teaches languages but also empowers users to become contributors. In doing so, OSLearn shifts learning from a one-way experience to a dynamic process of co-creation, where cultural and linguistic diversity become the foundation of progress rather than barriers to it.

In a world where online learning has become more prominent than ever, accessibility and adaptability are no longer optional, they are essential. Our vision for OSLearn was to design a platform that accommodates all learners, regardless of language, background, or technical ability. This meant prioritising clarity, usability and inclusivity while ensuring that the system remained open and extensible. From the earliest design decisions to the final deployment, the guiding question was always: how do we make this platform something anyone can learn from and build upon?

From a technical perspective, OSLearn combines a modern web architecture built on Next.js, Supabase, and Clerk with thoughtful UX design inspired by platforms like Duolingo, Udemy and GitHub. Each feature, from course creation and progress tracking to interactive flashcards and AI-generated quizzes, was implemented with the goal of balancing performance, collaboration, and simplicity.
