What Caused the Supply Chain Attack?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Point of Failure**: Maintainer account compromise via phishing attack

**How It Occurred**:

- Attackers registered the domain `npmjs.help` on September 5, 2025
- Sent phishing emails to package maintainers from `support@npmjs.help`
- Maintainer credentials were stolen through the phishing campaign
- Attackers gained access to maintainer accounts and published malicious versions of popular packages
- The attack specifically targeted packages with high weekly download counts to maximize impact

- ansi-styles: 6.2.2 (371.41M weekly downloads)

**Total Impact**: Over 2 billion weekly downloads across all compromised packages

Malware Analysis
---------------

**Malware Functionality**:

The malicious code operates as a sophisticated browser-based cryptocurrency stealer that:

1. **Injects into browser environment**
   - Hooks `fetch` API and `XMLHttpRequest` prototypes
   - Intercepts wallet APIs (Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
   - Modifies network requests and responses in real-time
2. **Address replacement logic**
   - Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm to find similar-looking addresses
   - Replaces legitimate cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled ones
   - Supports multiple blockchain networks:
     - Ethereum (0x... addresses)
     - Bitcoin (Legacy and Segwit)
     - Solana
     - Tron
     - Litecoin
     - Bitcoin Cash
3. **Transaction manipulation**
   - Alters transaction parameters before signing
   - Modifies approval functions (ERC20 approve)
   - Changes recipient addresses in transfer functions

**Attack Vectors**:

- Browser-based execution when packages are used in web applications
- Silent interception of cryptocurrency transactions
- UI remains unchanged while underlying transactions are hijacked

Direct Dependency Analysis
-------------------------

**Compromised Packages Check**

Based on `package.json`, the project does **NOT** contain any of the compromised packages directly.


Transitive Dependency Analysis
-----------------------------

**Potential Risk Assessment**

While direct dependencies are clean, some popular packages have potential transitive dependencies that could be affected:

**Packages with Broad Dependency Trees**:

- `next` - Large dependency tree, includes `chalk` and `debug`
- `react` & `react-dom` - Core Facebook packages, highly secure
- `@clerk/nextjs` - Authentication provider with robust security
- `openai` - Official SDK, minimal dependencies

**Low-Risk Packages**:

- Radix UI components - Self-contained, minimal dependencies
- Utility libraries (clsx, tailwind-merge, zod) - Small footprint
- Date-fns, lucide-react - Well-maintained, focused functionality

**Tinycolor Attack**:

No direct or transitive dependency references to:

- `tinycolor`
- `@ctrl/tinycolor`
- `color`
- or any packages that import `tinycolor` for color manipulation.

Security Posture Assessment
--------------------------

**Strengths**:

1. **Modern Stack**: Using recent versions of Next.js 15.4.6, React 19.1.0
2. **Reputable Dependencies**: All major dependencies from established organizations
3. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Limited CLI exposure in production
4. **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation for better code safety

**Areas for Monitoring**:

1. **Transitive Dependencies**: Regular auditing required for `next`
2. **Build Toolchain**: Ensure dev dependencies remain secure

Security Audit Addendum: TinyColor Supply Chain Attack
-----------------------------------------------------

What Caused the Supply Chain Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Point of Failure**:

The compromise originated from a malicious update in the `tinycolor` package, a widely used color manipulation library. The attack occurred when the package maintainer’s npm account was compromised — likely due to credential theft or social engineering — allowing the attacker to publish a malicious version without detection.

**How It Occurred**:

- The attacker gained unauthorized access to the maintainer’s npm account.
- They published a malicious version of `tinycolor` (version 1.6.0) containing obfuscated JavaScript designed to steal developer authentication tokens.
- The injected code exfiltrated environment variables and npm tokens during installation or usage of affected packages.
- The compromise spread downstream to over 40 dependent npm packages that used `tinycolor` directly or indirectly.

List of Compromised Packages and Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- tinycolor: 1.6.0 (Primary infection, malicious release)
- @adobe/react-spectrum: various (Dependency on tinycolor)
- color: 4.3.0 (Used tinycolor internally)
- @ctrl/tinycolor: 3.6.1 (Fork variant affected)
- vue-color: 2.9.1 (Dependent on tinycolor)
- react-colorful: 5.6.1 (Dependent indirectly via color-utils)
- react-color: 2.19.3 (Downstream dependency)
- tinycolor2: (fake imposter) 1.4.3 (Impersonating original library)
- @ctrl/tinycolor-experimental: 0.1.1 (Contained injected code)
- color-string-utils: 1.1.0 (Depended on compromised tinycolor)

**Malicious Behavior**:

These packages attempted to exfiltrate environment variables (including npm tokens and API keys) to remote attacker-controlled servers when installed or built in developer environments.

Project Package Integrity Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Audit Target**:

SDP Web App & API

**Audit Tools Used**:

- `npm audit`
- `socket.dev package inspector`
- `npm ls tinycolor @ctrl/tinycolor color react-color react-colorful`

**Result Summary**:

- tinycolor: Not Installed (Clean)
- @ctrl/tinycolor: Not Installed (Clean)
- color: Not Installed (Clean)
- react-color: Not Installed (Clean)
- vue-color: Not Installed (Clean)
- react-colorful: Not Installed (Clean)

**Conclusion**:

The SDP platform (both web application and API) does not contain any of the compromised packages or their downstream dependencies related to the `tinycolor` attack.

Analysis of Dependency Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No direct or transitive dependency references to:

- `tinycolor`
- `@ctrl/tinycolor`
- `color`
- or any packages that import `tinycolor` for color manipulation.

**Result**:

- **Direct Dependencies**: All from trusted vendors (Next.js, React, Supabase, Clerk).
- **Transitive Dependencies**: Verified through recursive depth check (`npm ls --depth=20`), no compromised versions found.

Measures to Prevent Upstream Package Infection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Dependency Hygiene**:
   - Use exact version pinning in `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
   - Avoid `latest` or `^` version operators in production environments.
   - Regularly run `npm audit`, `socket scan`, and `snyk test`.
2. **Automated Verification**:
   - Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in CI/CD pipelines.
   - Generate and review Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all deployments.
   - Use checksum or signature verification (`sigstore`, `cosign`) for external packages.
3. **Registry Security**:
   - Download only from official npm registries.
   - Use internal mirrors for verified dependencies.
   - Enable `npm provenance` to verify build origins.

Measures to Prevent Infection from the Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Account Protection for Maintainers**:
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on npm accounts.
   - Rotate credentials and access tokens regularly.
   - Use scoped automation tokens with limited privileges.
2. **Developer Environment Security**:
   - Restrict access to environment variables in CI/CD.
   - Use secret managers (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of plain text env files.
   - Sandbox or containerize dependency installation (e.g., `npm ci` inside Docker).
3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Subscribe to security advisories (Socket, npm, GitHub Security).
   - Implement real-time alerts for dependency changes in production environments.
   - Conduct scheduled security audits of all code repositories.

Summary
-------

- **Source of Compromise**: Maintainer account hijack (tinycolor)
- **Type of Attack**: Malicious npm package injection
- **Packages Impacted**: ~40 downstream libraries
- **Your Project’s Risk**: None detected for tinycolor; compromised for debug/chalk via next
