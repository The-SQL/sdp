Management Methodology
======================

Our team is following the **Scrum methodology**, an Agile framework designed to enhance collaboration, adaptability, and iterative progress. This approach ensures that we deliver a high-quality product while remaining responsive to feedback and changing requirements from the stakeholder.

Key Scrum Practices We Follow
-----------------------------

1. **Sprint Cycles**
   
   At the start of each sprint, we hold a **Sprint Planning Meeting** to:
   
   - Review the **product backlog** (prioritised list of features from stakeholders and bugs).
   - Define **sprint goals** and assign tasks based on team capacity.
   
   This ensures steady progress and allows for regular reassessment of priorities.

2. **Regular Standups (5-Minute Syncs)**
   
   We conduct regular **standup meetings** (virtually via WhatsApp or in-person). These meetings keep the team aligned and quickly address roadblocks (e.g., API integration issues).

3. **Collaboration (Google Meet and In-Person Meetings)**
   
   For real-time communication, we use:
   
   - **WhatsApp** for quick updates and urgent queries.
   - **GitHub** to track bugs and feature requests, ensuring transparency.
   - All major discussions and decisions are documented **on Notion** for future reference.

4. **Sprint Reviews & Retrospectives**
   
   At the end of each sprint, we hold:
   
   - A **Sprint Review** to demo completed work to stakeholders (e.g., instructors, peers).
   - A **Retrospective Meeting** to reflect on:
     
     - *What went well?* (e.g., effective API integration).
     - *What could improve?* (e.g., better task estimation).
     - *Action items* for the next sprint (e.g., allocate more time for testing).
